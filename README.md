The goal of my project: 

The goal of my project was to give the public this vital information about the increasing population in the world. I wanted to choose a country that is not that big, but is slowly starting to get larger every year, Bremuda. Thus, I created a project demonstrating the rising population of the country 'Bremuda' through a timeline of over 50 years (52 Years Exactly). I feel like this project provides the public the knowledge we need to know more about different parts of the world and how fast it is growing every year.
